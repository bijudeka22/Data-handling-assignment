The compiled machine code is then directly executed by the computer.\n","\n","- Interpretation: The source code is read and executed line by line by a program called an interpreter.The interpreter executes each line of code as it reads it.\n","\n","- Compiled languages are generally faster and more efficient, while interpreted languages are more flexible and easier to debug."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DLTL2jG-Q02r"},"source":["#2.What is exception handling in Python?\n","- Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to deal with errors that occur during the execution of a program. These errors, known as exceptions, can disrupt the normal flow of the program. Exception handling allows you to gracefully manage these errors, preventing your program from crashing and providing a way to recover or handle the situation appropriately."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YWYoWFRtRRyj"},"source":["#3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","- The finally block is essential for writing robust and reliable code. It ensures that cleanup operations are performed and that your program maintains a consistent state, regardless of whether exceptions occur.  It promotes predictable execution, making your code easier to manage and debug.\n","- The finally block in Python's exception handling mechanism serves a crucial purpose: it guarantees the execution of a block of code regardless of whether an exception was raised or not within the try block."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9jTssKuDTP1A"},"source":["#4.What is logging in Python?\n","\n","- Logging in Python is a way to record events that occur during the execution of a program. These events can range from informational messages to warnings and errors.  It's a crucial tool for debugging, monitoring, and understanding the behavior of your applications.  Instead of just printing to the console, logging provides a structured and flexible way to manage these records."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"anvs_QRNTlnC"},"source":["#5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","\n","- The __del__ method (also known as the destructor) in Python is a special method that is intended to be called when an object is about to be garbage collected.  However, its behavior and reliability are complex and often misunderstood, making it generally discouraged for most use cases.\n","- The primary purpose of __del__ is to allow an object to perform cleanup actions before it is destroyed."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oxxtlMFRUexF"},"source":["#6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n","\n","- import module_name is generally preferred, especially for larger modules, as it keeps your namespace cleaner and reduces the risk of naming conflicts. It also makes your code more readable by clearly indicating where each function or variable comes from.\n","- from module_name import name1, ... can be useful when you only need a few specific attributes from a module and want to avoid typing the module name repeatedly.\n","- In most cases, the import statement is the recommended approach for its clarity and safety regarding namespaces. However, from ... import can be useful in specific situations when used carefully."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0LuW_ddkb-aS"},"source":["#7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","\n","- Python offers a few ways to handle multiple exceptions:\n","1. Multiple except blocks:\n"," * Use separate except clauses for each exception type.\n"," * Python checks them in order, executing the first match.\n"," * Be specific with exceptions (e.g., ZeroDivisionError before Exception).\n","2. Single except with a tuple:\n"," * Handle related exceptions together using a tuple in one except block.\n"," * Less specific about which exception occurred.\n","3. Nested try...except:\n"," * Handle exceptions in a hierarchical way for different contexts.\n","4. try...except...else...finally:\n"," * else: Runs if NO exceptions occur.\n"," * finally: ALWAYS runs, for cleanup (files, resources).\n","Best practice:\n"," * Use multiple except for clarity and control.\n"," * Be specific with exceptions.\n"," * Use finally for cleanup."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"D52309V7c5Vv"},"source":["#8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n","- The with statement in Python simplifies file handling by automatically managing file opening and closing.  It ensures files are always closed, even if errors occur, preventing resource leaks and making code cleaner.  It uses context managers and the __enter__/__exit__ methods to achieve this.  In short, with guarantees file cleanup."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hESoPm12gpp-"},"source":["#9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n","\n","- Multithreading and multiprocessing are both techniques for achieving concurrency in Python, but they differ in how they execute tasks:\n","Multithreading:\n"," * Multiple threads within a single process: Think of threads as lightweight sub-processes that share the same memory space.\n"," * Concurrency: Threads run \"concurrently,\" meaning they take turns executing, giving the illusion of parallelism.\n"," * Limited by GIL: Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) allows only one thread to hold control of the Python interpreter at any one time. This limits true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.\n"," * Good for I/O-bound tasks: Multithreading is effective for tasks that involve waiting for input/output operations (e.g., network requests, file I/O) because threads can release the GIL while waiting.\n","Multiprocessing:\n"," * Multiple processes: Each process has its own separate memory space.\n"," * Parallelism: Processes can run in true parallel on multi-core processors.\n"," * Bypasses GIL: Multiprocessing is not affected by the GIL, making it suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n"," * More overhead: Creating and managing processes has more overhead than threads.\n","In short:\n"," * Multithreading: Lightweight, good for I/O, limited parallelism due to GIL.\n"," * Multiprocessing: Heavyweight, true parallelism, good for CPU-bound tasks."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MHtWjDoiiWqF"},"source":["#10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","\n","Logging offers several key advantages:\n"," * Debugging: Helps pinpoint errors by providing a trail of events.\n"," * Monitoring: Tracks application health and performance in production.\n"," * Auditing: Records important events for security or compliance.\n"," * Understanding behavior: Reveals how the program is used, even without errors.\n"," * Separation of concerns: Decouples information recording from presentation/storage."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hU8RFFTrixpd"},"source":["#11.What is memory management in Python?\n","\n","- Python's memory management handles how your program uses computer memory. It automatically allocates memory for objects (like variables) and reclaims memory when objects are no longer needed. This is done through:\n"," * Reference counting: Keeps track of how many things are referencing an object. When the count drops to zero, the memory is freed.\n"," * Garbage collection: Periodically checks for and reclaims memory used by objects that are no longer accessible.\n","This automatic memory management makes Python easier to use, as you don't have to manually allocate and deallocate memory. However, it's good to be aware of how it works to write efficient code."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ls1FH92yjntH"},"source":["#12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","\n","- The basic steps in Python's exception handling using try...except are:\n"," * try block: Enclose the code that might raise an exception within a try block.\n"," * except block(s): Follow the try block with one or more except blocks. Each except block specifies the type of exception it handles and the code to execute if that exception occurs.\n"," * (Optional) else block:  An optional else block can be added after the except blocks.  Code in the else block will execute only if no exceptions were raised in the try block.\n"," * (Optional) finally block: An optional finally block can be added.  Code in the finally block always executes, whether an exception was raised or not.  It's typically used for cleanup tasks (closing files, releasing resources)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IUK0TQyGmlQV"},"source":["#13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n","\n","- Memory management is vital in Python to prevent memory leaks (unused memory buildup), ensure efficient resource use, maintain program stability (avoiding crashes), optimize performance, and prevent serious errors like segmentation faults.  Basically, it keeps your programs running smoothly and reliably."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"D0N9yet7nCNE"},"source":["#14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","- try defines a block of code where an exception might occur. except specifies how to handle a particular type of exception if it happens within the try block.  Together, they allow you to gracefully manage potential errors, preventing your program from crashing."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0tWfXkxznvK-"},"source":["#15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","- Python's garbage collection primarily uses reference counting.  It tracks how many references point to an object. When that count drops to zero, the object is no longer accessible, and its memory is reclaimed.  Python also has a cyclic garbage collector that deals with circular references (where objects reference each other, even if no external code references them).  This collector identifies and reclaims these otherwise inaccessible objects."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BLcL8j2PoO7E"},"source":["#16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","\n","- The else block in a try...except statement executes only if no exceptions are raised within the associated try block.

It's a low-level system call, primarily available on Unix-like systems.  multiprocessing is a higher-level module that provides a cleaner and more portable way to create and manage processes, working across different operating systems (including Windows).  multiprocessing generally provides more features and is the recommended way to work with multiple processes in Python."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BpEdXW4ZpdP1"},"source":["#19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","\n","- Closing a file in Python is crucial because it releases the resources held by the file (like file handles) back to the operating system.  This prevents data corruption, ensures other programs can access the file, and avoids resource leaks, which can lead to instability or errors.  Basically, it's good practice for responsible resource management."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kucKaihFp261"},"source":["#20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","\n","\n","-  file.read() reads the entire file content as a single string. file.readline() reads only one line at a time, including the newline character at the end of the line.  So, read() gets everything at once, while readline() gets it line by line."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Hiu2NxISqUJq"},"source":["#21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n","- The logging module in Python provides a flexible way to record events that occur during program execution.  It's used for debugging, monitoring, auditing, and understanding program behavior.
